Hi, I am a PhD student in theoretical physics at McGill University, in Montréal. I study non-Hermitian systems under the supervision of Prof. [Tami Pereg-Barnea](https://pbtami.wixsite.com/mysite-1). In particular, I try to leverage topology as a resource for quantum-enhanced sensing protocols that could be implemented in the photonics lab of my co-supervisor, Prof. [Kai Wang](https://kw.physics.mcgill.ca/).
