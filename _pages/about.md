Hi, I am a PhD student in theoretical physics at McGill University, in Montréal. I study non-Hermitian systems under the supervision of Prof. [Tami Pereg-Barnea](https://pbtami.wixsite.com/mysite-1). In particular, I am interested in interactions between topology, disorder and nonlinearities. Moreover, I try to leverage topology as a resource for quantum-enhanced sensing protocols that could be implemented in the photonics laboratory of my co-supervisor, Prof. [Kai Wang](https://kw.physics.mcgill.ca/). 

Before that, I was an MSc student in mathematical physics in the group of Prof. [Vojkan Jakšić](https://jaksic.xyz/) at McGill University. My thesis focused on asymptotics of the maximum likelihood estimator.
